// functions in js
// uses return statement to return some result from the function
// the return statement goes back the line of the callee (where the function was called) as resumes the code workflow  
// function needs to be called
// functions used to do a particular task and calling that function as many times as needed

function abcd(){    // function defined
    return 'abcd';  // function body
}


// abcd();  function called but won't print anything because we used return statement
// we need to console/print the result of the function if we want to see it
//abcd() is just basic calling not any printing of output
// we can also store the result of the returned result

console.log(abcd());
